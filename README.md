ðŸŽ¤ _[Leader â€“ You Start | Duration: ~1.5 mins]_

Hello everyone,  
We are _Team JobHive_, and welcome to our final presentation. Today, weâ€™ll quickly walk you through our project, which is a _real-time hiring agency and communication platform_.

Letâ€™s start with a short _project overview_.  
JobHive is built to solve the _fragmented and time-consuming recruitment process_ by connecting _job seekers, employers, freelancers, and recruiters_ in one single platform.

ðŸ’¡ Through our platform, users can:
Post and search jobs  
Apply and track applications  
Schedule and attend live interviews  
Communicate in real-time  
And get career support via free resources

ðŸŽ¯ _The problem we solve:_  
In todayâ€™s remote-first world, recruitment needs to be _fast, efficient, and centralized_. Traditional platforms often lack real-time communication or integrated interview systems.  
_JobHive_ brings all these together in one platform, saving time and boosting hiring success.

ðŸ‘¥ _Targeted Audience:_

- _Job Seekers_ (freshers & professionals)
- _Employers & Recruiters_
- _Freelancers_ looking for flexible roles
- Especially focused on _remote jobs_ and _freelance opportunities_

Now Iâ€™ll quickly highlight _5 of our core features_ out of many:

1. _Job Posting & Search_  
   Employers can post jobs with full details, and job seekers can filter jobs by category, location, or salary.

2. _Profile & Resume Management_  
   Users can build detailed profiles, upload resumes, and even add 1-minute video introductions to showcase soft skills.

3. _Application & Hiring Workflow_  
   Users can apply directly, track their status, schedule interviews, and receive offer letters â€” all inside the platform.

4. _Multi-role Dashboards_  
   We created separate panels for Admins, Employers, and Job Seekers â€” each with tailored tools and access.

5. _Interview Scheduling with ZegoCloud_  
   Real-time video interview system â€” employers and job seekers can schedule and conduct interviews inside the site.

âœ… We also planned _real-time chat (Socket.IO)_ and _live notifications_, but due to time constraints, these features are still under development. Weâ€™ve kept the backend prepared for them and will complete them post-presentation.

âœ… In conclusion,  
_JobHive_ is not just a job board â€” it's a _complete recruitment ecosystem_, combining real-time communication, smart tools, and career support for modern hiring needs.

Weâ€™re proud of the journey â€” from concept to execution â€” and though not all features are 100% complete, our base is strong, scalable, and ready for future upgrades.
